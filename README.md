# IT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. (Alpha release!)
# MCNnet_2.0
Advanced node networking for Open Computers, still under active development.

## Currently written:
* Low-level commpunication between nodes & clients(searching & sending packets)
* Tunnel Nodes for cross-dimentional communication
* NADM for node administration!
* Network passwords!
* Protocols: MNP, MNCP(pinging), SSAP
* SSAP servers are working for use
* FTP protocol for transmitting files
* Domain names for servers
* Dynamic IPv2 addresses
* Network passwords & node administration utilities
* WDP protocol for static .tdf websites
* Web Browser 0.9
* APM package manager!
## Planned:
* UAP for logins
* WDP backend support

## About
MCNnet 2.0 stands for Minecraft Computer Node network, which is used to connect computers over distance using nodes. Not only you can connect two computers - you can create servers, which users will be able to join. The only limitation - nodes must be within 400 block range, as it's default connect range of wireless network card. However, usage of linked cards is possible, using Tunnel Nodes (Tnodes), allowing connections between distant places and across dimentions.
## IP address system
MCNnet uses it's own simple address system, which consists of first 4 digits of node's UUID and first 4 digits of client UUID, so they look like this: 12ab:34cd. Nodes have 0000 in their client ID, like this: 12ab:0000.
## Searching & route system
When trying to connect to specific ip address, mnp search will be run recursively on all nodes(without loops of course). These search packets will have TTL, so its not infinite(TTL is configurable). These packets will store each node ip address they went through, and ip address from which it originated. In case host is found, a packet is sent back to client. After that, the route is stored on client, and future connections will be using that route. 
## DNS
Servers will be able to have domain names, like "example.com". 
## Servers
Servers are clients which are running some application and handle connections from another clients. There are different protocols of connecting to server, each designed to accomplish specific tasks. It is also possible to write your own protocol!
# Protocols
**[SSAP]** - (done)Simple Server Application Protocol, allows simple terminal connection with basic I/O facilities.  
**[FTP]** - (done)simple File Transfer Protocol connection, however does not support TUI.
**[WDP]** - Web Document Protocol - protocol for simple static webpages.
**[SSTP]** - [Planned] Simple Site Transfer Protocol - graphical sites, as we know it.  
**[UAP]** - Universal Auth Protocol, for managing logins.
